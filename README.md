# FYS3150: Computational Physics
Courework for FYS3150 taught at the University of Oslo the autumn of 2016.
An introdution to numerical methods which are used in solving problems in physics and chemistry, including solutions of diffential equations, matrix operations, and eigenvalue problems, interpolation and numerical integration, modelling of data and Monte Carlo methods.

## Project 1: Thomas vs. LU
Solution to the Poission equation in special one-dimensional form. A tridiagonal matrix algorithm is implemented and compared in effeciency to the more general LU decomposition method.

## Project 2: Eigensystems
Solution to the Schr√∂dinger's equation for two electrons in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential well with and without repulsive Coulomb interaction.

## Project 3: Numerical Integration
The Euler-Cromer method and then the Velocity Verlet method is employed to solve a complex many-body problem, namely the solar system. Forces between the sun and all planets of the solar system, including Pluto, is computed. The orbits are then estimated by numerical integration.

## Project4: Magnetic phase transition with Monte Carly methods

## Project5: Monte Carlo model applied to a simple monetary model
