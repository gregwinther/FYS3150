# FYS3150: Computational Physics
Courework for FYS3150 taught at the University of Oslo the autumn of 2016.
An introdution to numerical methods which are used in solving problems in physics and chemistry, including solutions of diffential equations, matrix operations, and eigenvalue problems, interpolation and numerical integration, modelling of data and Monte Carlo methods.

## Project 1
Solution of Poission equation in special one-dimensional form. A tridiagonal matrix algorithm is implemented and compared in effeciency to the more general LU decomposition method.
